ChatApp (Java Socket Programming)

This ChatApp is a simple client-server based messaging application built using Java socket programming. It demonstrates real-time communication between two systemsâ€”where one acts as a Server and the other as a Client. The server listens for incoming client connections, and once connected, both parties can exchange messages instantly via the command-line interface.

The project is a great example of how networking concepts like ServerSocket, Socket, input/output streams, and multithreading are used in Java to build basic real-time applications. This can serve as a foundation for more advanced chat applications with GUI or group chat features.
